            <article class="hidden billc-card" id="billc-bio">William Thomas Compton, born April 9, 1835, and more commonly known as Bill Compton or Vampire Bill, was a major character on the HBO original series True Blood. Played by British starring actor Stephen Moyer, Bill made his debut in the series' premiere episode, "Strange Love", in the series' first season. A former Confederate soldier living in the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, Bill was turned into a vampire around the year 1865 when the Civil War ended. At the time of the Great Revelation, Bill had decided to "mainstream" and co-exist peacefully with humans. He has since been converted to the Sanguinista movement and believes himself to be the chosen form of Lilith. Playing a recurring role through the series' first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons, and becoming one of the series' main antagonists throughout much of its fifth and sixth seasons, Bill was the primary love interest of series' protagonist Sookie Stackhouse. After contracting the fatal disease Hepatitis V, and per his final request, Bill met his demise by Sookie’s hands before he could fully succumb to the disease in the series' finale episode "Thank You", in the series' seventh, and final, season.</article>
